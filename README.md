# Automobile-Price-Predictor
This ML algorithm predicts the price of an automobile respective to a wide variety of features.
Points to note:
1. Different algorithms were used on the same dataset. Only the best performing model i.e., Random Forest was included in this repository.
2. The quality of data in the dataset was questionable and had a lot of missing data.
3. The dataset (taken from a UCI Repository) contained a huge set of features so necessary feature extraction was used to make the model perform well.
4. Despite the feature extraction and data quality challanges, I managed to get a satisfactory accuracy, that is included in the code provided.
